## How to run ðŸš€
### run with all the combination
To run the program with all the combination of data and methods just run `GARunner.java`.
### run all the combination with differents hyperparameters
To run the program using differents hyperparameters(MaxRounds, population size, ecc...) you can change the values of the variables beetween line 13 and 18 in the `GenericAlgorithm.java` file, and then run again `GARunner.java`.

### run a specific combination of problem instance
You can run a specific combination of istance change the path in line 115 and 117 in `GenericAlgorithm.java` and run this time `GenericAlgorithm.java`.

## Generate Charts
For generate the charts we use a Jupiter Nootbook that you can find in `visualization/drawDiagram.ipynb`.
